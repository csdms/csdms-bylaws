\article{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}

The following Bylaws will be used to govern the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS). 

\subsection{About CSDMS}

The US National Science Foundation supports the CSDMS Integration Facility (CIF) to accelerate research and applications across earth-surface sciences by engaging and coordinating the scientific community, developing and curating state-of-art cyberinfrastructure, and providing opportunities and resources for education. CSDMS is an open, community-led organization that helps the research community collaboratively develop and use a shared, modular, and ever-improving system for computational modeling and data-model integration.



\article{Membership}


\subsection{Eligibility for Membership}

CSDMS is an inclusive Earth sciences community with a purposefully broad body of members. Membership is open to US and foreign individuals. Members shall have a major commitment to research in Earth System Science with a particular emphasis on computational earth-surface dynamics, and related fields. CSDMS encourages members from all career stages, academic, government and industrial/commercial domains. Applicants may apply to the CIF to join one or more of the CSDMS Working and Focus Research Groups. The CIF shall maintain a list of Members and their Institutions available for public viewing on the CSDMS Web Portal.


\subsection{Open Membership Meetings} Each year, a variety of open meetings are available for member participation.

\subsubsection{Annual Meetings} 

An annual meeting of the members shall take place; the specific date, time, format, and location (if applicable) of which will be designated by the Executive Director.  At the annual meeting the members shall receive a report on the activities CSDMS, be provided an opportunity for input to help determine community needs, and, if necessary, vote on pertinent group business.

\subsubsection{Special Meetings} 

Special meetings may be called by the Steering Committee chair, the Executive Director, or a simple majority of the Executive Committee. A petition signed by five percent (5\%) of voting members may also call a special meeting.

\subsubsection{Notice of Meetings} 

Written notice of Open Membership Meetings shall be given to each voting member not less than one month prior to the meeting.


\subsection{Voting Privileges}

CSDMS members in good standing are granted the privilege of voting for a replacement Steering Committee Chair and, when requested by the Executive Director or CSDMS Executive Committee, of voting on occasional community actions where the direct input of the membership is deemed necessary to determine direction.  Any action or voting required to be taken by the CSDMS members may be taken/made electronically without an onsite meeting of the CSDMS members.


\subsection{Resignation and Removal}

Any member may resign by filing a written notice to the CSDMS Executive Director or the Director?s designee.  Such resignation shall take effect at the time of receipt of the notice, or later as specified therein. Given sufficient cause, a member can have their membership terminated by an affirmative vote of 2/3rds of the voting members of the CSDMS Executive Committee.



\article{CSDMS Groups and Initiatives}

CSDMS is founded on the principle of community engagement. To that end, CSDMS has six Working Groups and six Focus Research Groups that provide members with networking, research, and educational opportunities.  Additionally, there are a number of Initiatives that are shorter-term efforts often focused on specific/narrow research questions or tasks. 


\subsection{Responsibilities and Activities of Groups}

\begin{itemize}
\item Group Discussion: Stay current in the processes and models associated with their disciplinary toolkit and identify gaps in knowledge and areas where numerical tools need to be developed. Set scientific modeling priorities for their discipline. Make recommendations for resource prioritization.
\item Review Activities: Ensure quality control for the algorithms and modules for their area of expertise.  
\item Group Project: Address a CSDMS proof-of-concept challenge, as appropriate. 
\item Individually and collectively:  Stimulate proposals and input from the community. Create and/or manage the various environmental process modules related to their discipline. Provide community continuity to meet long-term CSDMS objectives.
\item Meetings: Groups and Initiatives will coordinate much of their activity via remote communication systems, but are encouraged to meet as resources and interests permit. 
\item Reporting: Groups and Initiatives will report annually on their progress to the CSDMS Executive Director.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{CSDMS Working Groups}

The six Working Groups (WGs) that presently support the CSDMS program include three Environmental Working Groups, two Integrative Working Groups, and one Interagency Committee.   

\subsubsection{Environmental Working Groups}

The Environmental Working Groups are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item	Terrestrial WG: weathering, hillslope, fluvial, glacial, aeolian, lacustrine; 	
\item	Coastal WG: delta, estuary, bays and lagoons, nearshore; 
\item	Marine WG: shelf, carbonate, slope, deep marine.   
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Integrative Working Groups}

The Integrative Working Groups are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  Education and Knowledge Transfer (EKT) WG: includes marketing to gain end-users, workshops to provide training for end-users, and web-based access to educational resources.  
\item  Cyber-Infrastructure and Numerics WG: includes technical computational aspects of CSDMS, ensures that the modeling system properly functions and is accessible to users; software protocols are maintained, along with model standardization and visualization.  
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Interagency Committee}

The Interagency Committee fosters linkages among the main US environmental agencies that have interest in CSDMS products, standards, and approaches.

\subsubsection{Working Group Membership}

Membership in the CSDMS WGs is open to all CSDMS members in good standing.  Members may belong multiple groups.  Members may join a WG during the initial registration process or any time after membership has been granted. Members are expected to contribute to group activities when requested by the group Chair. For the purposes of electing a Working Group Chair, each CSDMS WG member shall be entitled to one vote cast electronically.  The CSDMS Integration Facility must receive votes by the deadline specified in the ballot.  All other voting on group business will be through a majority of the Working Group members present at the time of the vote (e.g. Annual Meeting of the Working Group).

\subsubsection{Working Group Chairs}

Each Working Group will be led by one or two Chairs who have expertise in the working group domain. Chairs of the working groups will be full voting members of the Executive Committee. They will have the authority to call meetings of the group they are responsible for and to meet the collective long-term CSDMS objectives.  

\subsubsection{Working Group Chair Elections}

Chairs of Working Groups shall be elected by the members of the respective working groups by simple majority vote, orchestrated and recorded by the CSDMS Program Coordinator, for a three-year term, and shall be eligible for re-election. In consultation with the Steering Committee Chair and the Working Group?s co-Chairs, the Executive Director will nominate one or two candidates to stand for election for each working group chair position to be filled. Working Group members are encouraged to suggest nominees to the Executive Director. 

\subsubsection{	Working Group Meetings}

Working Groups shall conduct one group meeting each year and provide feedback to the CSDMS Executive Director and to the Executive Committee during their semi-annual meetings.

\subsubsection{	Establishment and/or dissolution of Working Groups}

Working Groups may be established or discontinued by a majority vote of the Executive Committee. 


\subsection{CSDMS Focus Research Groups}

The CSDMS Focus Research Groups (FRGs) were established in 2008 to cut across the Environmental Working Group structure and to serve a unique subset of the surface dynamics community, often with support of well-developed co-sponsoring organizations.  The current FRGs include:      
\begin{itemize}
\item	Hydrology FRG is cosponsored by CUAHSI, the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc;  
\item	Chesapeake FRG is co-sponsored by the Chesapeake Community Modeling Program; 
\item	Critical Zone FRG is co-sponsored by NSF?s Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) Program and the International Soil Modeling Consortium (ISMC); 
\item	Human Dimensions FRG is co-sponsored by the AIMES (Analysis, Integration and Modeling of the Earth System) project of the Future Earth Programme , and by CoMSES Net (the Network for Computational Modeling for Socio Ecological Science);
\item	Geodynamics FRG (not currently sponsored by an outside organization);
\item	Ecosystem Dynamics FRG is co-sponsored by the International Society for Ecological Modelling (ISEM). 
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Focus Research Group Membership}

Membership in the CSDMS FRGs is open to all CSDMS members in good standing.  Members may belong to multiple groups.  Members join a FRG during the initial registration process or any time after membership has been granted. Members are expected to contribute to group activities when requested by the group Chair. Members do not vote on FRG Chairs. All other voting will be through a majority of the FRG members present at the time of the vote (e.g., Annual Meeting of the Focus Research Group). 

\subsubsection{	Focus Research Group Chairs}

Each Focus Group will be led by one or two Chairs who have expertise in the working group domain. Chairs of the Focus Research Groups will be full voting members of the Executive Committee. They will have the authority to call meetings of the group they are responsible for and to meet the collective long-term CSDMS objectives. Focus Research Group Chairs are responsible for liaising between the co-sponsoring organization and the CSDMS Executive Committee.  Chairs of the FRGs report directly to the CSDMS Executive Director and, where applicable, to the Chair or Director of the co-sponsoring organization. 

\subsubsection{	Focus Research Group Chair Appointments}
Focus Research Group Chairs are appointed by the CEO of the sponsoring organization and the CSDMS Executive Director. FRG Chairs shall serve a term of 3 years renewable by consent of the group?s sponsoring organization and the CSDMS Executive Director.

\subsubsection{Focus Research Group Meetings}

Focus Research Groups shall conduct one group meeting each year and provide feedback to the CSDMS Executive Director and to the Executive Committee during their semi-annual meetings.
\subsubsection{	Establishment and/or dissolution of Focus Research Groups}

Focus Research Groups may be established or discontinued by a majority vote of the Executive Committee.  


\subsection{CSDMS Initiatives}

CSDMS Initiatives were established to encourage short-term, transdisciplinary research. The current Initiatives include: Coastal Vulnerability (led by the Coastal WG), Continental Margins (led by the Marine WG), Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (led by the Cyber WG), Exploring Interoperability of Open Modeling Platforms, River Network Modeling.  Initiatives may be established or discontinued by agreement between the Executive Director and one or more Group Chairs.


\subsection{Special or Standing Committees}

The Executive Committee and Executive Director may create special or standing committees as may be deemed desirable, the members of which shall be appointed by the Executive Director from among the Membership.  Each such committee shall have only the powers specifically delegated to it by the Executive Committee.
